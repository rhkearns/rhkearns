## About Me
I am a thoughtful and solutions-driven software developer, with a passion for creating enjoyable experiences for all. Through attention to detail and creative problem solving, I strive to find new and inventive ways of approaching every situation. Both routine and unusual occurances bring out my best work, adapting to new situations with the same care I bring to the ordinary. Experienced primarily in JavaScript, with a focus on React and Redux, I have also used Python, Sass, and am actively learning Ruby.
